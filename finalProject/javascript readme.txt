________Lil Bro's Snacktime________

similar to the Snake game released on various platforms. (Most notably the Nokia 6110) 

Goal of the game is to eat as much berries you can without eating yourself. Of course the more you eat, the longer you get. Sadly no score for berries, but the length can be used as a score. Eating yourself causes an instant reset, and the boundaries are like pacman leading to the other side. This was my favorite to make.

________How Fast?_______

similar to Aimlabs on PC and Mobile. Goal of the game is to click the shape as fast as you can. No overall score, but time in between clicks are recorded in the box. Can be used to help reaction time and aiming!
